# ADR 0002: Per-assembly dev harness pattern


## Status
Accepted


## Context
Each assembly should have a dedicated development harness to exercise and test functionality in isolation. This harness is distinct from the formal test project.

## Decision
Each assembly will be accompanied by a dev harness project, a simple console app that references the assembly and allows fast prototyping and interactive debugging. A separate test project will be maintained for automated validation.

## Consequences
- Dev harnesses enable rapid iteration and exploration.
- Assemblies remain isolated and teachable.
 - Test projects provide automated coverage.
 - Risk of duplication across harnesses can be mitigated by a shared common project.
- CI/CL should exclude dev harnesses from automated builds and tests.

## References
Documentation of this pattern should live in `docs/decisions`/ for future contributors.
