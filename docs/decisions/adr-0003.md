# ADR 0003: Root solution plus per-assembly solutions hybrid model


## Status
Accepted


## Context
We have multiple assemblies and want to balance isolated development with integrated workflow. We need to avoid a single "big box" solution, but we also want each assembly to have its own fokused solution with a dev harness.
 

## Decision
We establish a hybrid model:
- Root solution (MetWorks.sln) at repo root, containing all assemblies and their test projects.
- Per-assembly solutions (e.g. MetWorks.Core.Diagnostics.sln, MetWorks.Core.Models.sln) with just the assembly and its dev harness.
- Every assembly can be built and debugged in isolation, or as part of the root solution.

## Consequences
- Developers can focus only on the assembly they need.
- Root solution enables Integration, CI/CL, and onboarding.
- Solution sprawl is managable as long as documentation clearly explains the pattern.
- Exceptions must be documented in `docs/decisions/` for future contributors.
