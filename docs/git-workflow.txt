Git Workflow Cheat Sheet This project uses a simple 4‑step loop to keep local and remote branches in sync.

Daily Workflow

Sync before starting work Command: git pull origin main --rebase

Fetches new commits from GitHub (origin).

Rebases your local commits on top of the remote main branch.

Keeps history linear (no merge bubbles).

Make changes

Edit files or add new ones.

Save them in the repo folder.

Stage and commit Command: git add <files> Command: git commit -m "Describe your change"

git add tells Git which files to include.

git commit records the snapshot with a message.

Push to GitHub Command: git push origin main

Uploads your commits to the remote main branch.

Makes them visible on GitHub.

Conflict Handling

If git pull --rebase stops with conflicts:

Open the files marked with <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>.

Fix the content manually.

Stage the fixed files: git add <file>

Continue the rebase: git rebase --continue

Push again: git push origin main

Best Practices

Always pull with rebase before starting new work.

Write clear commit messages.

Keep changes small and focused.

Use git status often to see what’s staged, committed, or untracked.
